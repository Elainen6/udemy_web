    <p><em>Computer Science student at <strong>IMT Atlantique</strong> </em></p>
    <p>
        I have a wide range of software development experience during my internships.
        This includes implementation of algorithms on large-scale software systems.
        Passionate about programming, I have started studying data structures and algorithms
        in my spare time since graduation of high school. Looking for a full-time software engineer position.

        <li>Sep. 2022--March. 2023, <strong>VR application for teaching</strong>, IMT Atlantique, Brest, Graduation
            Project</li>
        Description: <br>
        Using Unity 3D and C#, I designed and implemented a generic collaborative virtual environment with four other
        students,
        which creates and proposes new methods to support learning in specially adapted environments and allows the
        implementation
        of numerous learning situations
